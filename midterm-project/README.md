### INTRODUCTION: 
   Medical insurance premium is the amount of money paid to the insurance provider to get health insurance coverage. The calculation of the medical insurance premiums is a non trivial task since it depends on a various set of factors. It requires a comprehensive analysis of the customer profile, historical data as well as assessing the risk factors. It is important to know that every insurer uses its own assumptions and has its own set of standards to calculate the health insurance premium. 
   
### DATA: 
   The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tejashvi14/medical-insurance-premium-prediction).
   It contains health related parameters of the customers:
   - `age` : age in years
   - `anychronicdiseases` : binary variable, takes 0 or 1 value
   - `anytransplants` : binary 0/1 variable
   - `bloodpressureproblems` : binary 0/1 variable
   - `diabetes` : binary 0/1 variable
   - `height` : height in centimeters
   - `historyofcancerinfamily` : binary 0/1 variable
   - `knownallergies` : binary 0/1 variable
   - `numberofmajorsurgeries` : represents a number of surgeries 
   - `weight` : weight in kilograms
   
   The premium price is in inr(â‚¹) currency and shows annual amounts. 
   
### OBJECTIVE: 
   Use machine learning approach in order to simplify the process of calculating the premium amount as for customers as for insurance providers at the same time providing accurate, reliable results and additional insights. 
   
### CONTENTS:
   This repository contains the following files:
   - `notebook.ipynb` with data preparation, EDA, model training and selection process.
   - `train.py` - code for training and saving models. 
   - `service.py` which loads the saved model and contains code for serving it using BentoML. 
   - `bentofile.yaml` with dependencies, package versions, descriptions and some other info required for building bentos with BentoML. 
   - `medicalpremium.csv` - the dataset that was used for this project. It can be downloaded from this repository as well. 

### MODEL:
   Various models and approaches were tested, Random forest and XGBoost performed better than others. XGBoost model deployed using BentoML platform which provides fast and easy solution for this purpose. You can discover more about BentoML [here](https://docs.bentoml.org/en/latest/). 

### HOW TO RUN THE MODEL:
   The easiest way to run and test the model is to pull the docker image of that model from this [public repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/vanyadmitrovich/premium-prediction). Run this command in terminal to download the image (*keep in mind that Docker should be installed and running on your system*):
   - `docker pull vanyadmitrovich/premium-prediction`
   
  Use the following command to run the image:
   - `docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 vanyadmitrovich/premium-prediction:latest serve --production`

  After that the service will be running on http://localhost:3000/ 
  
  You can play around with model by navigating to "POST" tab and clicking "Try it out" button. The "Request body" form will appear where it will be possible to enter application data, keep in mind appropriate parameters ranges listed in DATA section of this document to get adequate results. You can also try the following values to test the model, just copy-paste it into "Request body":
  
  ```
  {
  "age": 56,
  "anychronicdiseases": 1,
  "anytransplants": 0,
  "bloodpressureproblems": 1,
  "diabetes": 0,
  "height": 169,
  "historyofcancerinfamily": 0,
  "knownallergies": 0,
  "numberofmajorsurgeries": 2,
  "weight": 65
}
```

  Click "Execute" to score entered data. The resulting prediction (Premium price) will appear in "Response body" window.
